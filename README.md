# Compatibility of Automobile Parts



## Overview
This project aims to model the compatibility of automobile parts within a system. 
The compatibility relationships are represented as a directed acyclic graph (DAG), allowing users to understand which parts can be assembled together. The system uses a graph-based data model and can be implemented using a graph database or a relational database.
## Data Model

###  Node (Part)
 - Attributes:
   - Name
   - Serial Number
   - Manufacturer
   - Weight
 - Relationships:
   - Outgoing edges represent compatibility with other parts

##  Database model
### Part Table:

| ID | Name          | Serial Number | Manufacturer | Weight |
|----|---------------|---------------|--------------|--------|
| 1  | Engine        | ENG123        | Ford         | 500    |
| 2  | Transmission  | TRANS456      | GM           | 200    |
| 3  | Wheel         | WHEEL789      | Michelin     | 30     |

- **ID:** Unique identifier for each part.
- **Name:** The name of the automobile part (e.g., Engine, Transmission, Wheel).
- **Serial Number:** A unique identifier assigned to each part.
- **Manufacturer:** The company that produced the part (e.g., Ford, GM, Michelin).
- **Weight:** The weight of the part.

### Compatibility Table:

| PartID | CompatiblePartID |
|--------|-------------------|
| 1      | 2                 |
| 1      | 3                 |
| 2      | 3                 |

- **PartID:** Foreign key referencing the ID column in the Part table, indicating the part for which compatibility is defined.
- **CompatiblePartID:** Foreign key referencing the ID column in the Part table, indicating a part that is compatible with the corresponding Par

## Scalability
### Tens of Millions of Parts
 - Graph databases are designed for efficient traversal and querying of relationships.
 - Indexing and sharding can be employed to optimize query performance.

### High Frequency Updates
- Batch processing for updates to minimize the impact on the system.
- Caching mechanisms and indexing strategies to optimize retrieval.
- Partitioning and Sharding for distribution of data load.
